Despite the advancements in AI and machine learning for disease detection, most 
existing systems are limited to identifying a single disease. This lack of versatility 
forces individuals to rely on multiple tools for different conditions, leading to 
increased complexity and inefficiency in the diagnostic process. The quick expansion of technological knowledge requires Artificial Intelligence to function as a fundamental component in modern human daily activities. The human race has reached a stage where Artificial Intelligence can identify diseases through simple input data or symptom descriptions. People can detect diseases with high precision through this AI-Based Multi-Disease Detection system. The AI-based system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for medical image feature extraction while using multiple machine learning (ML) techniques (such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression and XGBoost) to process sequential data for improved accuracy and model efficiency. 

The system receives training through multiple datasets that incorporate medical 
images and patient health records and time-series information. The system's 
diverse input data allows it to detect multiple diseases including Breast Cancer, 
Heart Disease, Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, Diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Malaria, 
Pneumonia, Parkinson’s and Common Flu. 

Users submit mеdicаl data through structured intеrfаcеs, triggering analysis by 
condition-sреcific AI models. Not mеrеly an automation tool, but а risk mitigation 
framework. This approach deliveries actionable insights for informed hеalthcаrе 
dеcisions, раrticulаrly vаluаblе in rеsourcе-constrаinеd еnvironmеnts. 
Architecturally, the system uses dеер lеаrning frаmеworks, Convolutionаl 
Nеurаl Nеtworks (CNNs) рrocеss imаging data (X-rays, MRIs) for Alzhеimеr’s аnd 
рnеumoniа detection, while Recurrent Nеurаl Nеtworks (RNNs) аnаlyzе temporal 
health metrics relevant to diаbеtеs аnd cardiac conditions. Hybrid model integration 
еnsurеs cross-disciplinary diаgnostic accuracy. 
The future development plans consist of extending the model to analyze complex diseases while deploying mobile 
applications and offline access.

Algorithms taken for each disease:
• The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated superior performance in tabular data
based diseases including diabetes, kidney and heart since it provided accurate 
results.  
• The SVM model delivered the most effective outcome when analyzing liver 
disease data because it excels at processing small and complicated datasets. 
• Fine-Tuned CNNs delivered superior performance compared to other models 
when analyzing image-based diseases specifically malaria and pneumonia.  
• The structured input data received effective processing through the 
implementation of XGBoost in Parkinson’s disease predictions.  
• The Baseline CNN achieved high recall and F1 scores in Alzheimer’s detection 
while maintaining a low precision rate. 
• Logistic Regression proved most effective for breast cancer diagnosis by 
providing both performance quality and operational simplicity. 
• The JavaScript-based diagnostic logic delivered fast and precise results through a 
lightweight system for symptom-based common flu diagnosis.
