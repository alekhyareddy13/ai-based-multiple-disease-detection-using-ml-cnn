The quick expansion of technological knowledge requires Artificial Intelligence 
to function as a fundamental component in modern human daily activities. The 
human race has reached a stage where Artificial Intelligence can identify diseases 
through simple input data or symptom descriptions. People can detect diseases 
with high precision through this AI-Based Multi-Disease Detection system. The 
AI-based system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for medical 
image feature extraction while using multiple machine learning (ML) techniques 
(such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, 
and XGBoost) to process sequential data for improved accuracy and model 
efficiency. 
The system receives training through multiple datasets that incorporate medical 
images and patient health records and time-series information. The system's 
diverse input data allows it to detect multiple diseases including Breast Cancer, 
Heart Disease, Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, Diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Malaria, 
Pneumonia, Parkinson’s and Common Flu. The hybrid approach that combines 
CNN and RNN enables feature learning and temporal pattern recognition and 
optimization capabilities for real-world healthcare and clinical applications. The 
experimental findings showed excellent precision together with minimal incorrect 
results and performance across different datasets. The future development plans 
consist of extending the model to analyze complex diseases while deploying mobile 
applications and offline access.
